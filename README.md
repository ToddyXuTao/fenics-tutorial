FIXED BUGS IN THE OFFICIAL TUTORIAL OF FEniCS.
  FEniCS is a popular open-source (LGPLv3) computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient finite element code. With the high-level Python and C++ interfaces to FEniCS, it is easy to get started, but FEniCS offers also powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers. FEniCS runs on a multitude of platforms ranging from laptops to high-performance clusters.
  When I was learning the official tutorial, I found a few problems when running the codes. Special thanks to my friend Qi Lu, we fix the all the problems we found in the tutorial. I hope this document could help more beginners who want to learn FeniCS.
